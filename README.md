# Leaflet Nectarivore

Leaflet Nectarivore is a plugin to create layers based on remote services (Overpass, Osmose, etc.). Its name is a nod to [Leaflet Omnivore](https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-omnivore), which _eats_ several kind of files to display informations on a Leaflet map. Leaflet Nectarivore _gathers nectar_ from remote services to create its layers on the map.


**This project is heavy development phase, don't use it in production until the first 1.0.0 stable version.**
